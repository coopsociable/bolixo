<b>Make yourself visible on bolixo.org</b>

You have an account on Bolixo. Great. By default, you are invisible. Unless you tell a friend, nobody can find you. You can change this if you want.
Go in the 3 dots menu (top right) and select the <em>Profile</em> option, then <em>Account</em> on the left. Look at the section <em>Public information</em> in the dialog. Fill the section, enable the <em>Publish to bolixo.org directory</em> checkbox and submit.

Then you can visit https://bolixo.org and select the <em>search</em> (top right) option. Try to find yourself.
