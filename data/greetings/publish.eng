<b>Write your own public messages</b>

By default, everything you write on Bolixo is private. You may want to <em>publish to the world</em>. Every user has a <em>public</em> group. In the <em>Talk</em> section, you select that group and write messages or upload images or videos.

Just follow this _HELP=publish to complete the configuration. Once done, the whole world will be able to follow your latest adventures. Even better, make yourself visible in https://bolixo.org.
