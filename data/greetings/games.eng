<b>Play games</b>

You can play some games (checkers, chess, sudoku and tictacto for now). Visit the <em>projects</em> tab, then select your public project. Create a Sudoku game, give it a name. Then click on it and it will show up in a tab on the right. Select the complexity and there you go.

Invite a friend, give him access to your public group and you will be able to solve the puzzle together.
