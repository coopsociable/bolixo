<b>Documents and games</b>

There is a white board program. It allows you to quickly create graphs and presentations. It is multi-users, allowing everyone to enhance the drawing at once.

You can play some games (checkers, chess, sudoku and tic-tac-toe for now). Visit the <em>projects</em> tab, then select your public project. Create a Sudoku game, give it a name. Then click on it and it will show up in a tab on the right. Select the complexity and there you go.

Invite a friend, give him access to your public group and you will be able to solve the puzzle together.

All documents and games have a chat.
