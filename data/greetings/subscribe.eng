<b>Subscribe to public messages</b>

Bolixo allows users to publish toughts, ideas, recipies, etc... to the world. Each user doing so ends with a public page. For example, here is the public page of user bolixonews@alpha.bolixo.org: https://alpha.bolixo.org/public/bolixonews.

Instead of visiting each user public page one after the other, Bolixo allows you to subscribe to public page. The public messages will end up in your main screen.

Here is the _HELP=interests to the relevant documentation. To find other users, you may want to visit the https://bolixo.org and do a search there.
